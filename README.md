With increase in urbanisation and industrialisation, to meet the needs of the vast
population of our country, but with this growth , we are posing a serious threat to our
earth. Air pollution poses significant risks to public health, animals, nature and the
environment. Pollutants like SO2,NO2,PM2.5, PM10 (Particulate Matter) are really
dangerous, causing various diseases like lung cancer, Asthma, bronchitis etc. Thus,
accurate prediction of Air Quality Index (AQI) is essential for timely interventions
and mitigating adverse effects. This research paper presents a comprehensive
approach to predicting air quality using machine learning techniques like Regression,
Random forest, time series forecasting etc. We have used the dataset of cities of India
showing the various pollutants present in the air from 2015 to 2020. By leveraging
historical air quality data and various environmental parameters, we build predictive
models to forecast air quality indices (AQI). The results demonstrate the potential of
machine learning in enhancing air quality monitoring and prediction, offering
valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners.
